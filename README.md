# Android Cleaner
Almost every Android Phone comes with programs that the OEMs don't want their customers to disable. Trouble is, these programs are garbage and we can always find better alternatives in the Google Play Store. Android Cleaner helps in disabling these useless programs.

# How to Use
1. You will need to install *Package Name* on your Android Phone. [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csdroid.pkg)

# FAQ
### Why Disable and Not remove?
Disabled applications can be easily re-enabled should the need arise. This makes it a safer option compared with complete removal.

### How Does it Work?
Android Cleaner uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to perform its interactions with your device. **ADB needs to be installed on your system before you can use this script**.
